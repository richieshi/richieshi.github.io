							<h2>Hi, I am Richie Shi</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems,
							and building software that can improve people's quality of life. In my past internships, I worked on software that help improve the education
							obtained and provided by students and teachers around the world.

								<h3>YouTube Music Player</h3>
								<p>
									This is a desktop application that you can use to create playlists of and listen to music that is available on YouTube.
									The front end was created using React, Redux and Electron, and the backend was created using Python (Flask library) and MySQL.

								<h3>Yelp Review Classifier</h3>
								<p>
									I trained a classifier using a <a href="https://www.yelp.ca/dataset_challenge">Yelp dataset</a> of reviews to categorize reviews by their sentiment (i.e. bad, neutral, good).
									I created this in order to better understand the process of using machine learning algorithms to learn from data as well as
									research and apply NLP techniques to understand text. Currently, the classifier successfully predicts the sentiment of reviews with an accuracy of 84% using
									a logistic regression model.

								<h3>Straights</h3>
								<p>
									Straights is a card game where you try to empty your hand by creating straights on the board. You can play against other players or against the computer.
									This game was created using C++ with the GTK+ library for the user interface. This was created for a software design principles class so source code will not be available.
									If you would like to see it, please <a href="mailto:richie_shi@hotmail.com">contact me</a>.
